My self Bhimagani Ranjith. I have done this project as a minor project from HDLC TECHNOLOGIES.
A basic calculator project in Python is a simple program that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculator takes input from the user, performs the selected operation on the input values, and then displays the result to the user.
